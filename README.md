# Splatterbeans
An attempt at creating an online multiplayer FPS game between flying beans with jetpacks! Features a skin selection menu, creating and joining rooms, and various maps with core gameplay mechanics.

Development is currently paused, but I hope to return to this project in the future. 
* Networking logic was built using Unity Networking system (uNet), but is deprecated in newer versions of Unity. Would need to migrate to a new networking solution that is also more scalable. 
* Character movement updates for multiple players very high latency.
